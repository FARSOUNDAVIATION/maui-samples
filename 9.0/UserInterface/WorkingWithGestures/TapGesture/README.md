# TapGesture

This sample demonstrates using the `TapGestureRecognizer` class to implement tap gesture recognition in .NET MAUI.

The sample shows three different ways to implement tap gestures:
- Direct tap handling on an Image with visual feedback
- Tap gesture recognition on a Frame container
- Using XAML with Command binding and data binding patterns
